title: The idea

<div class="text">
	<p>
		In the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/"> Eclipse
			Modeling Project</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf">EMF</a>
		is a modeling framework combined with a code generation tooling. The <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2"> UML2</a>
		project completes the EMF modeling functionalities in order to respect
		the standard.
	</p>
	<p class="special">The link between code and modeling is code
		generation, taking advantage of the EMF infrastructure. If such a use
		of UML can be very efficient with appropriate tools, it becomes very
		difficult to perform re-factoring operations on a code which was not
		generated from an EMF-compliant model.</p>
	<p>
		The Eclipse <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/">Java development
			tools</a> provide, after a compilation, an <a
			href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_an_AST%3F">AST</a> : an
		analyzed version of the code, which can be accessed through a <a
			href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_the_Java_model%3F">
			Java Model</a>, what becomes interesting especially for re-factoring
		operations. On this infrastructure rely Eclipse functions for code
		changes (packages, classes, properties, methods renaming, etc).

		Another <em>Sourceforge</em> project has a similar shape : the <a
			href="http://green.sourceforge.net/">Green UML</a> Eclipse plug-in. <span
			class="latine">Coffea</span> is today less evolved but aims to
		provide integration with the foundation UML2 editors. Developers could
		in a same time use interesting modeling tools and manipulate code with
		it.
	</p>
	<p>The project first idea was to manipulate this model through the
		Eclipse UML2 tools, as Java developers do every day using the Eclipse
		Java tools.</p>
	<p>As UML2 Tools are no longer being maintained, an adaptation is
		being developed for the Papyrus editors.</p>
	<p class="special">
		UML graphical notations provide a synthetic perception of verbose text
		resources from programming languages. It can be used as a software
		architecture tool. The idea behind <span class="latine">Coffea</span>
		becomes interesting as it links architecture and code.
