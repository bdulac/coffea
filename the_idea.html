            As UML is a language, it can seem natural to consider its use in 
            the perspective we consider programming languages.  
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 
            <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/">
            Eclipse Modeling Project</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf">EMF</a>
            is a modeling framework combined with a code generation 
            tooling. 
            <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2">
        	UML2 tools</a> complete the EMF modeling functionalities, 
        	implementing standards. The link between code and modeling is 
        	code generation, as seems natural to programmers used to compile 
        	code.  
          </p>
          <p>
            If such a use of UML can be very efficient with appropriate 
            tools, it becomes very difficult to perform re-factoring operations 
            on a code which was not generated from a formal model. The 
            following question is : where can be a model found to allow this 
            kind of operation ?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eclipse <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/">Java development 
            tools</a> provide, after a compilation, an 
            <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_an_AST%3F">AST</a> : 
            an analyzed version of the code, which can be accessed through a 
            <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_the_Java_model%3F">
            Java Model</a>, what becomes interesting especially for 
            re-factoring operations. On this infrastructure rely Eclipse 
            functions for code changes (packages, classes, properties, 
            methods renaming, etc).
          </p>
          <p>
            The project idea is to manipulate this model through the Eclipse 
            UML2 tools, as Java developers do every day using the Eclipse Java 
            views.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another <em>Sourceforge</em> project has a similar shape : 
            the <a href="http://green.sourceforge.net/">Green UML</a> Eclipse 
            plug-in. <em>Coffea</em> is today less evolved but aims to provide 
            integration with the foundation UML2 editors. Developers could in 
            a same time use interesting modeling tools and manipulate 
            code with it.
          </p> 
          <p>
            Some could object UML allows to 
            express things that do not exist in a language like Java. This is 
            a point which has not been solved until now.
          </p>
          <p>
            UML graphical notations provide a synthetic perception of 
            verbose text resources from programming languages. It can be used   
            as a software architecture tool, as the 
            <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Unified-Modeling-Language-User-Guide-The/9780321267979.page">
            UML user guide</a> illustrations 
            suggest it. 
            Along the code modification functionality, <em>Coffea</em> also aims to 
            provide an overview of the code.
